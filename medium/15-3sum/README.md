# 15. 3Sum

Given an array `nums` of _n_ integers, are there elements _a_, _b_, _c_ in `nums` such that `a + b + c = 0` ? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

## Note

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

## Examples

```
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
```

## Notes

- Had some trouble with this one, didn't think to split between positive, negative, and zeroes

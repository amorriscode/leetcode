# 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

Given a string containing digits from `2-9` inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

## Examples

**Input:** `"23"`
**Output:** `["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]`

## Note

- Answer can be in any order

## Lessons

- It is useful to think more about the different approached prior to coding
- Iteration is obviously poor on this, but what about the recursive method?

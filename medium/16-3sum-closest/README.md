# 15. 3Sum Closest

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

## Examples

```
Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

## Notes

- Solved the `O(n^3)` solution first; this would probably make me fail an interview ðŸ˜‚
- Two pointers in a for loop create an `O(n^2)` solution

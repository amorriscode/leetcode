# 28. Implement strStr()

Implement `strStr()`.

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or `-1` if needle is not part of haystack.

## Example 1

**Input:** haystack = `"hello"`, needle = `"ll"`
**Output:** 2

## Example 2

**Input:** haystack = `"aaaaa"`, needle = `"bba"`
**Output:** `-1`

## Clarification

What should we return when `needle` is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return `0` when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's `strstr()` and Java's `indexOf()`.

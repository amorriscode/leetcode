# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

## Example:

**Input:** 1->2->4, 1->3->4
**Output:** 1->1->2->3->4->4

## Lessons

- Always think about the base cases (what if your arguments are empty?)
- Stop using `console.log` and reason about the program

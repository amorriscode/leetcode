# 136. Single Number

Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears _twice_ except for one. Find that single one.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

## Example 1

**Input:** [2,2,1]
**Output:** 1

## Example 2

**Input:** [4,1,2,1,2]
**Output:** 4

## Lessons

- Math tricks definitely help algorithsm become faster and smaller in space

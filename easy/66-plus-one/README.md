# 66. Plus One

Given a **non-empty** array of digits representing a non-negative integer, plus one to the integer.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contain a single digit.

You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

## Example 1

**Input:** `[1,2,3]`
**Output:** `[1,2,4]`

## Example 2

**Input:** `[4,3,2,1]`
**Output:** `[4,3,2,2]`

## Lessons

- Try to think of the base case first
- Try to solve the problem without running the code
- I started writing code then switched my approach and rewrote everything; probably could've been avoided by thinking more up front

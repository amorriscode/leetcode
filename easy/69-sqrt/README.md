# 67. Add Binary

Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of _x_, where _x_ is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

## Example 1

**Input:** `4`
**Output:** `2`

## Example 2

**Input:** `8`
**Output:** `8`
**Explanation:** The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.

## Lessons

- I would not have been able to solve this in an interview; had to use Wikipedia for the formula...
- The solution can also be solved with binary search
